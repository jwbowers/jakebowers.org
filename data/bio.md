Jake Bowers is a professor in the Departments of [Political
Science](https://pol.illinois.edu) and
[Statistics](https://stat.illinois.edu) at the [University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu). His methodological research focuses on
the design and analysis of both randomized experiments and non-randomized
observational studies in the service of understanding human behavior and
improving public policy. His work on human behavior includes research on COVID
vaccination attitudes in the USA, attitudes towards taxation in Malawi, and the
perceptions of group relationships in neighborhoods in Canada.

He currently serves as the Methods Director for the [Evidence in Governance and
Politics (EGAP)](https://egap.org) network and co-founder and co-director of
the new Arnold Ventures Criminal Justice Research network.

Since 2015 he has worked at the intersection of social and behavioral science,
applied statistics of causal inference, and public policy with the [Office of
Evaluation Sciences](https://oes.gsa.gov) in the General Services
Administration of the US Federal Government (during 2015 the OES was publicly
known as the [White House Social and Behavioral Sciences
Team](https://web.archive.org/web/20250516010449/https://sbst.gov./)), [The Policy Lab @ Brown
University](https://thepolicylab.brown.edu), as a Research Affiliate and Fellow
at the [Center for Advanced Study in the Social and Behavioral
Sciences](https://casbs.stanford.edu), where he co-founded the [Causal
Inference for Social Impact
Lab](https://casbs.stanford.edu/programs/causal-inference-social-impact-lab)
together with [Carrie
Cihak](https://www.linkedin.com/in/carrie-s-cihak-43059174/), and as a
co-founder of [Research4Impact](https://r4impact.org), an organization
that connects researchers and practitioners to improve public policy,
governance, and advocacy. He also helped create the first [Latin American
Political Methodology meeting](https://lapolmeth.info/) in Santiago, Chile in
2017.

Some of his work with EGAP led to an online textbook on field experiments: [The
Theory and Practice of Field Experiments: An Introduction from the EGAP
Learning
Days](https://egap.github.io/theory_and_practice_of_field_experiments/index.html),
with translations into
[Spanish](https://egap.github.io/theory_and_practice_of_field_experiments_spanish/)
and
[French](https://egap.github.io/theory_and_practice_of_field_experiments_french/). He teaches about causal inference and experiments in the [EGAP Learning Days](https://egap.org/learning-days/) in Latin America as well as in the [Escuela de Invierno de Metodods](https://www.ucu.edu.uy/categoria/Escuela-en-Metodos-367).
