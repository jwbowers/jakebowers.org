@phdthesis{leavittDesignBasedBayesianCausal2021,
	abstract = {Scholars have recognized the benefits to science of Bayesian
	            inference about the relative plausibility of competing hypotheses
	            as opposed to, say, falsificationism in which one either rejects or
	            fails to reject hypotheses in isolation. Yet inference about causal
	            effects \textemdash{} at least as they are conceived in the
	            potential outcomes framework (Neyman, 1923; Rubin, 1974; Holland,
	            1986) \textemdash{} has been tethered to falsificationism (Fisher,
	            1935; Neyman and Pearson, 1933) and difficult to integrate with
	            Bayesian inference. One reason for this difficulty is that
	            potential outcomes are fixed quantities that are not embedded in
	            statistical models. Significance tests about causal hypotheses in
	            either of the traditions traceable to Fisher (1935) or Neyman and
	            Pearson (1933) conceive potential outcomes in this way; randomness
	            in inferences about about causal effects stems entirely from a
	            physical act of randomization, like flips of a coin or draws from
	            an urn. Bayesian inferences, by contrast, typically depend on
	            likelihood functions with model-based assumptions in which
	            potential outcomes \textemdash{} to the extent that scholars invoke
	            them \textemdash{} are conceived as outputs of a stochastic,
	            data-generating model. In this dissertation, I develop Bayesian
	            statistical inference for causal effects that incorporates the
	            benefits of Bayesian scientific reasoning, but does not require
	            probability models on potential outcomes that undermine the value
	            of randomization as the ``reasoned basis'' for inference (Fisher,
	            1935, p. 14).In the first paper, I derive a randomization-based
	            likelihood function in which Bayesian inference of causal effects
	            is justified by the experimental design. I formally show that,
	            under weak conditions on a prior distribution, as the number of
	            experimental subjects increases indefinitely, the resulting
	            sequence of posterior distributions converges in probability to the
	            true causal effect. This result, typically known as the
	            Bernstein-von Mises theorem, has been derived in the context of
	            parametric models. Yet randomized experiments are especially
	            credible precisely because they do not require such assumptions.
	            Proving this result in the context of randomized experiments
	            enables scholars to quantify how much they learn from experiments
	            without sacrificing the design-based properties that make
	            inferences from experiments especially credible in the first
	            place.Having derived a randomization-based likelihood function in
	            the first paper, the second paper turns to the calibration of a
	            prior distribution for a target experiment based on past
	            experimental results. In this paper, I show that usual methods for
	            analyzing randomized experiments are equivalent to presuming that
	            no prior knowledge exists, which inhibits knowledge accumulation
	            from prior to future experiments. I therefore develop a methodology
	            by which scholars can (1) turn results of past experiments into a
	            prior distribution for a target experiment and (2) quantify the
	            degree of learning in the target experiment after updating prior
	            beliefs via a randomization-based likelihood function. I implement
	            this methodology in an original audit experiment conducted in 2020
	            and show the amount of Bayesian learning that results relative to
	            information from past experiments. Large Bayesian learning and
	            statistical significance do not always coincide, and learning is
	            greatest among theoretically important subgroups of legislators for
	            which relatively less prior information exists. The accumulation of
	            knowledge about these subgroups, specifically Black and Latino
	            legislators, carries implications about the extent to which
	            descriptive representation operates not only within, but also
	            between minority groups.In the third paper, I turn away from
	            randomized experiments toward observational studies, specifically
	            the Difference-in-Differences (DID) design. I show that DID's
	            central assumption of parallel trends poses a neglected problem for
	            causal inference: Counterfactual uncertainty, due to the inability
	            to observe counterfactual outcomes, is hard to quantify since DID
	            is based on parallel trends, not an as-if-randomized assumption.
	            Hence, standard errors and p-values are too small since they
	            reflect only sampling uncertainty due to the inability to observe
	            all units in a population. Recognizing this problem, scholars have
	            recently attempted to develop inferential methods for DID under an
	            as-if-randomized assumption. In this paper, I show that this
	            approach is ill-suited for the most canonical DID designs and also
	            requires conducting inference on an ill-defined estimand. I instead
	            develop an empirical Bayes' procedure that is able to accommodate
	            both sampling and counterfactual uncertainty under the DIDs core
	            identification assumption. The overall method is straightforward to
	            implement and I apply it to a study on the effect of terrorist
	            attacks on electoral outcomes.},

@phdthesis{schneiderEssaysPublicPolicy2018,
	abstract = {This dissertation consists of three essays. The first essay looks
	            at the impact of a Brazilian law that first prohibited concealed
	            carry and then provided a referendum asking voters whether guns
	            should also be banned in the country. It exploits the abrupt change
	            that prohibited all citizens to carry guns to identify the effects
	            of this law on crimes and to understand which part of society are
	            more likely to benefit from gun control. Once this connection is
	            established, I investigate whether the part of the society that
	            benefitted the most from the concealed carry ban were also more
	            likely to support the gun prohibition referendum. The second and
	            third essays investigate the impact of the phased-in introduction
	            to electronic voting in Brazil. In particular, the second essay
	            looks at whether electronic voting, by eliminating the possibility
	            of fraud after voting, impacted the usage of an alternative
	            electoral malfeasance named voter buying (i.e., paying outsiders to
	            transfer electoral registration into a given candidate's district
	            to increase votes for that candidate). It then examines whether
	            clientelistic parties were hurt by the new voting system. The third
	            and last essay investigates whether electronic voting, by de facto
	            enfranchising poorer and less educated voters, also impacted public
	            spending. Connecting all three essays is the fact that they all
	            relate to Brazil and analyze the impact of public policies. Below
	            are the title and individual abstracts for each of the three
	            essays. Chapter 1: Crime and political effects of a concealed carry
	            ban in Brazil. This paper studies the effects of legislation in
	            Brazil that banned the carrying of concealed weapons nationwide in
	            2003, and provided for a voter referendum 22 months later regarding
	            whether to ban the sale of all firearms in Brazil. Using a
	            regression discontinuity design, I find that in the wake of the law
	            gun-related homicides decreased by 10.8 percent, with the reduction
	            especially pronounced among young black males living in high-crime
	            areas. Other crimes involving guns (robberies) also declined, while
	            crimes that did not involve guns were unaffected. Enrollment in
	            adult education courses disproportionately increased in areas that
	            saw the biggest drop in gun-related crimes. Economic benefits are
	            estimated to exceed \$3 billion. Analysis of the subsequent voter
	            referendum, which was defeated by a wide margin, shows higher voter
	            turnout and stronger support for the complete weapons ban in the
	            areas that had experienced the greatest decline in gun-related
	            homicides. Chapter 2: Does voting technology affect clientelism?
	            This paper studies the phased-in introduction of electronic voting
	            systems in Brazil to examine whether the technological shift
	            affected clientelism. The new technology undercut voter fraud that
	            had previously been shown to take place with paper ballots after
	            voting (i.e., adding votes to tabulation sheets after voting has
	            ended). At the same time, the new technology increased the relative
	            appeal of voter fraud via voter buying (i.e., paying outsiders to
	            transfer electoral registration into a given candidate's district
	            to increase votes for that candidate). I find that municipalities
	            using electronic rather than paper ballots experienced larger
	            increases in the number of registered voters suggesting an increase
	            in voter buying. Even though voter buying is a clientelistic
	            strategy, electronic voting decreased support for clientelistic
	            parties indicating that fraud after voting was a more effective
	            electoral malfeasance, especially because voter buying requires
	            compliance and I find that voting turnout was smaller in places
	            using electronic voting. Chapter 3: Electronic voting and Social
	            Spending: The impact of enfranchisement on municipal public
	            spending in Brazil. This article studies the effect of political
	            participation on municipal level public spending. We use the
	            gradual introduction to electronic voting in Brazil, which
	            especially enfranchised poorer voters in the legislative elections,
	            to identify the causal effect of voting on public spending. A
	            theoretic, political economy model suggests that, by de facto
	            enfranchising the poor, electronic voting increases social
	            spending. We test this prediction empirically using as instrument
	            the introduction to electronic voting, which affects voting
	            enfranchisement without directly influencing public spending. We
	            first apply a two-stage least square regression and then we
	            validate our estimation using a difference-in-differences
	            methodology. We find in our preferred specification that an
	            increase of 1 percentage point in the valid vote to turnout ratio
	            for state representatives increases health spending by 1.42\%;
	            education by 1\%; public employment by 1.28\%; total spending by
	            1.26\%; total revenue by 1.07\% and intergovernmental transfer by
	            1.11\%.},

@phdthesis{soppelsaEmpiricalModelsLand2017,
	abstract = {This dissertation concentrates on land use, both urban and rural,
	            in United States. First, I focus on land conservation and study how
	            state fiscal incentives can affect private land conservation on the
	            eastern region of the country. Then, I move to urban uses of land
	            and analyze how distance to certain amenities in a city can affect
	            residential and non-residential uses, using spatial econometric
	            techniques. Finally, taking advantage of the same methodology, I
	            concentrate on conservation easements and estimate the probability
	            of different levels of public access and how certain variables
	            affect these probabilities. In the first chapter, I study the
	            effect that state level incentives have on land conservation.
	            Private decisions about land conservation are crucial for
	            preservation of endangered species as 80\% of their habitats are on
	            private land. I study the efficacy of state tax breaks to promote
	            private land conservation. I use the Protected Area Dataset of
	            United States and construct a county-year level panel of the flow
	            of undeveloped land protected per year. I use fixed effects panel
	            estimations combined with optimal full matching to improve balance
	            on observable covariates between treated and control counties.
	            Results show that, on average, counties in a state with a tax break
	            more than double the yearly flow of conservation after the
	            incentive is in place. These findings suggest that state tax breaks
	            are an effective incentive to promote land conservation. In the
	            second chapter, I concentrate on land use in an urban area and how
	            spatial econometric techniques can help explain land use decisions.
	            I use a large geo-referenced data set and estimate the probability
	            of residential use for individual lots in the urban area. I
	            specifically concentrate on the difficulties that this type of data
	            sets presents and how to overcome them. Spatial data sets pose
	            challenges for discrete choice models because the data are unlikely
	            to be independently and identically distributed. A conditionally
	            parametric spatial probit model is amenable to very large data sets
	            while imposing far less structure on the data than conventional
	            parametric models. I illustrate the approach using data on 474,170
	            individual lots in the City of Chicago. The results suggest that
	            simple functional forms are not appropriate for explaining the
	            spatial variation in residential land use across the entire city.
	            In the third chapter, I focus only on conservation easements in
	            continental US. Conservation easements generally have a specified
	            level of public access: open, restricted, or closed to the public.
	            This chapter focuses on these particular levels of public access
	            and how location and other variables play a role in that decision.
	            A conditionally parametric multinomial logit model estimates how
	            these variables affect the probability of each level of access. By
	            allowing coefficients to vary throughout space I find effects not
	            capture by standard or spatial logit models. Results show that
	            effects not only differ by level of public access but also
	            spatially. These findings provide useful information for shaping
	            regional policies that are able to address these differences when
	            promoting conservation for specific purposes that allow different
	            levels of public access.},

@phdthesis{townsenRebelliousMindExplaining2015,
	abstract = {Conflict scholarship has developed a complex understanding of how
	            socio-economic factors influence the individual choice to join a
	            rebel group, but conflict scholarship also lacks progress an
	            understanding of how an individual's predispositions toward
	            specific behaviors influence this decision. This dissertation
	            investigates which individual predispositions are likely to
	            influence the decision to join a rebel group. In examining these
	            predispositions, I seek to also answer whether the same
	            predispositions are likely to influence the behavior or rebel group
	            members. While the behavioral predispositions are likely to be
	            numerous, I focus on variation in personality traits and
	            specifically on an individual's level of trait aggression. I argue
	            that personality traits are stable predictors of behavior and
	            likely to influence joining behavior by placing personality trait
	            variation in the broader context of the decision to join a rebel
	            group. I find that variation in trait aggression plays an important
	            role in the individual decision to join a rebel group and that
	            trait aggression also influences the way individuals perform in a
	            commonly used rational choice game. Finally, I argue that studying
	            personality traits is important outside the civil war context and
	            find that aggression also predicts which individuals are likely to
	            join a traditional state military. The theoretical and empirical
	            contributions of this project show that conflict participation
	            models that take individual differences seriously better represent
	            the decision making process.},

@phdthesis{arackalNotMyBrother2014,
	abstract = {Why, during an ethnic conflict, would an ethnic group turn its
	            weapons against itself? That is the question that motivates this
	            dissertation. Such behavior is puzzling because as an ethnic group
	            devotes valuable time, energy, and resources on an intra-group
	            conflict, it reduces the total amount of resources the group can
	            draw on to wage the ethnic conflict. Unfortunately, the ethnic
	            conflict literature provides few answers to the puzzle of
	            infighting during ethnic conflict because the ethnic conflict
	            literature generally assumes that ethnic violence increases ethnic
	            cohesion. I examine that assumption in detail, and find it both
	            theoretically and empirically flawed. Instead, I argue that both at
	            the factional level and at the individual level, ethnic violence
	            creates incentives and opportunities for fragmentation, and the
	            ethnic leadership then engages in infighting to counter this
	            pressure. I test the theory using both large-n statistical analyses
	            , as well as process tracing and case studies. Both empirical
	            analyses provide evidence to support the theory, challenging the
	            claim that ethnic violence increases ethnic cohesion. Ultimately, I
	            conclude that infighting during ethnic conflict is the irrational
	            macro-level outcome of rational micro-level choices.},

@phdthesis{rudkevichCorrelatesPoliticalAlignment2014,
	abstract = {This dissertation investigates the determinants of interstate
	            political alignment, examining why states join others in
	            conflictual or cooperative endeavors and which side they take in
	            those situations. The puzzle it seeks to address is why some states
	            are much more likely to gain support than others, and whether the
	            likelihood of such support varies on the basis of the issue under
	            dispute and the characteristics of the state itself. The
	            dissertation emphasizes the interests of rulers, particularly in
	            their need to obtain support on issues of high salience to them.
	            The desire for future reciprocation lies at the heart of these
	            alignment decisions. First, leaders consistently reciprocate
	            positive and negative alignments, rarely changing sides in
	            consecutive conflicts. Second, rulers avoid positively aligning
	            with leaders of unstable or politically unrepresentative states, as
	            the latter are less likely to be in a position to return the favor.
	            After providing a general explanation of alignment, the
	            dissertation demonstrates that not all alignments are created
	            equal. The willingness of rulers to reciprocate is contingent on
	            the cost and discernibility of past alignment decisions. A ruler
	            who provided unambiguous support to another and paid a large price
	            for doing so can expect future support more readily than someone
	            who did not. I test the theory in three chapters, two quantitative
	            and one qualitative. In the former, the hypotheses relating to
	            reciprocation and regime characteristics are tested on a new
	            dataset consisting of all potential interventions into existing
	            wars, MIDs, and sanctions. The qualitative chapter consists of a
	            case study of the former Soviet Union from 1991 to the present, and
	            attempts to determine whether alignment decisions made by those
	            states were for reasons specified in the alignment theory.},

@phdthesis{travlosWarmongersPeacebuildersMajor2013,
	abstract = {This project is an evaluation of the role major power managerial
	            coordination played in the transformation of the international
	            system from a war-inducing to a peace-inducing system. In pursuit
	            of this goal I develop the concept of the regime of major power
	            managerial coordination and argue that it was a novel innovation in
	            late-18th century great power politics which greatly transformed
	            conflict dynamics in international relations since 1816. Major
	            power managerial coordination is the engagement of the major powers
	            in consultation, multilateralism and the avoidance of adversarial
	            coordination. The goal is to decrease the likelihood of major power
	            military conflicts. Because minor power conflicts can bring in
	            major powers by diffusion, the major powers engaged in managerial
	            coordination also strive to decrease the likelihood of the use of
	            military force by all states in the international system. Major
	            Powers engage in managerial coordination because their ruling
	            elites became wary of war as an instrument of foreign policy due to
	            fear of the consequences of great power war for their domestic
	            political position. Beginning from the argument developed by Paul
	            Schroeder that the Napoleonic wars were the first instance in which
	            the majority of major powers suffered adverse results for domestic
	            power structures, I develop an explanatory story of how the major
	            powers engaged in managerial coordination decrease the likelihood
	            of military conflict onset. This is via three mechanisms. One is
	            denial, the denial of major power diplomatic and military support
	            for the use of military force by other states. The second is
	            discouragement, the threat of major power intervention and censure
	            that may lead states to avoid the use of military force in order to
	            resolve disputes. Finally, the pacification of international
	            relations by major power managerial coordination may indirectly
	            facilitate peace-fostering developments such as democratic reforms
	            within states, and the creation of international organizations. It
	            is thus that the transformation of international politics was
	            brought about. To evaluate the transformation thesis, I develop the
	            scale of major power managerial coordination intensity, a novel
	            replicable instrument that captures how intensely the major powers
	            are engaged in managerial coordination. To permit the comparison of
	            pre-transformation and post-transformation conflict onset dynamics
	            I compiled a new dataset of militarized interstate disputes in the
	            1715-1815 period. This complements the extant datasets on the
	            1816-2001 period. I then conducted quantitative evaluations of a
	            number of hypotheses extracted from the explanatory story I
	            presented. The findings supported the arguments that managerial
	            coordination was a novel innovation for late 18 th and early 19th
	            century international relations. The findings also indicate that
	            increasing managerial coordination decreases the likelihood that
	            two states would experience a military conflict in the 1816-2001
	            periods. Furthermore this is more likely to be due to denial rather
	            than discouragement mechanisms. Finally, there were indicators that
	            increasing managerial coordination fosters democratic reforms
	            within states, but that it does not make states more likely to join
	            international organizations. These findings will be of interest to
	            those studying the evolution of the international political system,
	            those studying how structural phenomena influence the behavior of
	            states, scholars researching the impact of the Vienna System in the
	            form international relations have today, and scholars engaged in
	            research on conditions that help alleviate the issue of the use of
	            military force in international relations.},

@unpublished{bowehans:2005,
	abstract = {Statistical analysis requires a probability model: commonly, a
	            model for the dependence of outcomes Y on confounders X and a
	            potentially causal variable Z. When the goal of the analysis is to
	            infer Z's effects on Y , this requirement introduces an element of
	            circularity: in order to decide how Z affects Y , the analyst first
	            determines, speculatively, the manner of Y 's dependence on Z and
	            other variables. This paper takes a statistical perspective that
	            avoids such circles, permitting analysis of Z's effects on Y even
	            as the statistician remains entirely agnostic about the conditional
	            distribution of Y given X and Z, or perhaps even denies that such a
	            distribution exists. Our assumptions instead pertain to the
	            conditional distribution Z|X, and the role of speculation in
	            settling them is reduced by the use of such techniques as
	            propensity scores, poststratification, testing for overt bias
	            before accepting a poststratification, and optimal full matching.
	            Such beginnings pave the way for ``randomization inference'', an
	            approach which, despite a long history in the analysis of designed
	            experiments, is relatively new to political science and to other
	            fields in which experimental data are rarely available. The
	            approach applies to both experiments and observational studies. We
	            illustrate this by applying it to analyze A. Gerber and D. Green's
	            New Haven Vote 98 campaign. Conceived as both a get-out-the-vote
	            campaign and a field experiment in political participation, the
	            campaign as it turned out was in some ways more similar to an
	            observational study than to a randomized experiment. Our analysis
	            uses the strengths of the design of their study while adjusting for
	            irregularities ignored by the original analysis. We estimate the
	            number of voters who would not have voted had the campaign not
	            prompted them to --- that is, the total number of votes
	            attributable to the interventions of the campaigners. Both our
	            statistical inferences about these attributable effects and the
	            stratification and matching that precede them rely on quite recent
	            developments from statistics; our matching, in particular, has
	            novel features of potentially wide applicability. Our broad
	            findings resemble those of the original analysis by Gerber and
	            Green (2000), although in the small, the method offers additional
	            information as to the campaign's effects upon interestingly
	            different subgroups, such as older voters or those who have not
	            voted in a previous election. },

	abstract = {This paper elaborates statistical models for the analysis of
	            regulatory review deadlines or ``review time goals'' and their
	            influence upon regulatory decisions. We outline two sets of
	            statistical methods for estimating the models. In the first set,
	            dynamic duration models of time to decision are elaborated, with
	            particular focus on semi-parametric methods from which the
	            behavioral structure of a regulatory review can be induced or
	            ``backed out.'' In the second set, we consider different estimators
	            for observational analysis of whether the deadlines in question
	            influence the ``quality'' of the reviews or the likelihood of
	            error. In particular, we consider how to use results from the
	            ``first stage'' (induced behavioral review structure) to test
	            whether deadlines influence the distribution of error. We apply
	            these methods to the imposition of review-time goals by the
	            Prescription Drug User-Fee Act (PDUFA) and its amended successors
	            upon new drug review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
	            (FDA). Using the first set of methods, we find broad evidence that
	            the deadlines have induced a piling of approvals right before the
	            deadline elapses. Using the second set of methods, we find that
	            these ``pre-deadline'' approvals are subject to substantially
	            different post market experiences than drugs approved either after
	            the deadlines or ``very early'' in the approval process.},

	abstract = {We use longitudinal data incorporating three generations of
	            Americans to reevaluate the character and consequences of political
	            socialization within the family. Findings about parental influence
	            based on youth coming of age in the 1990s strongly parallel those
	            based on youth socialized in the 1960s. As expected on the basis of
	            social learning theory, children are more likely to adopt their
	            parents political orientations if the family is highly politicized
	            and if the parents provide consistent cues over time. The direct
	            transmission model is robust, as it withstands an extensive set of
	            controls. Early acquisition of parental characteristics influences
	            the subsequent nature of adult political development.},
